import shutil
# Shutil is a Python module that provides a higher level interface for working with file and directories. The name "shutil" is short for shell utility. It provides a convenient and efficient way to automate tasks that are commonly performed on files and directories. In this repl, we'll take a closer look at the shutil module and its various functions and how they can be used in Python.

"""
The following are some of the most commonly used functions in the shutil module:

shutil.copy(src, dst): 
This function copies the file located at src to a new location specified by dst. If the destination location already exists, the original file will be overwritten.

shutil.copy2(src, dst): 
This function is similar to shutil.copy, but it also preserves more metadata about the original file, such as the timestamp.

shutil.copytree(src, dst): 
This function recursively copies the directory located at src to a new location specified by dst. If the destination location already exists, the original directory will be merged with it.

shutil.move(src, dst): 
This function moves the file located at src to a new location specified by dst. This function is equivalent to renaming a file in most cases.

shutil.rmtree(path): 
This function recursively deletes the directory located at path, along with all of its contents. This function is similar to using the rm -rf command in a shell."""

# Copy File
# shutil.copy("./data/students.txt", "./data/pdf/students.txt")

# Copy directory
# shutil.copytree("./data/pdf/", "./data/new_pdf/")

# Move or rename file
# shutil.move("./data/students.txt", "./data/new_students.txt")

# Recursively delete directory
# shutil.rmtree("./data/new_pdf/")
